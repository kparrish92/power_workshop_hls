Which language known by a bilingual impacts L3 acquisition? 
 
Does it matter which languages a bilingual knows, and which third language they are learning?

Should we expect different linguistic domains, such as morphosyntax and phonology, to be influenced in the same way by previously learned language in an L3 learner?

---

# Literature Review

.large[
**Models of L3A**

- The **Typological Primacy Model** (TPM) <sup>1</sup> :perceived typological similarity causes either the L1 or the L2 to transfer to the L3, but not both. 

- The **L2 Status Factor** <sup>2</sup> "the second learned language will influence the L3 by default, and "block" access to the L1. 

- The **Linguistic Proximity Model** <sup>3</sup> :structure-by-structure influence is possible, but does not predict when it occurs.

???
Discuss psychotypology - it's the learners "choice" based the how L3 input is parsed that leads to the holistic transfer of one whole language system. This is said to be more cognitively economical. 

L2SF - briefly mention the DP model - the cognitive similarity between the L2 and L3 motivate this methods 

LPM - there is no predictive power to this model.

# Literature Review

.large[
**Evidence for Full Transfer Models**

- Systematic review of 92 L3 empirical studies: 59/92 typology, 29/92 L2 status<sup>1</sup> 

 - These findings were not coded in a mutually exclusive manner.

- 25 studies reported L2 status, but were coded as providing evidence for both TPM and the L2SF. 
 
 - No mirror image groups

- The L2 Status Factor has received empirical support from many language combinations (see final slides)

# Literature Review 

.large[
**Issues with the TPM**

- Lack of variance in the participants' choice of language to transfer. 
 - Only one study shows variance in language selection (Falk, Lindqvist, and Bardel, 2015)
 - High metalinguistic awareness resulted in L1 transfer

- Lack of cross-linguistic support.
 - All studies that support TPM involve 2 Romance Languages and English<sup>1</sup>.
]

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> See final slides for list of studies supporting this observation. 
]

# Literature Review 

.large[
**Work in L3 phonology**

- Most studies have focused on production<sup>1</sup> 

- Only 1 perception study in adults has been done and focused on the influence of the L3 on the L2 (Liu et al., 2019)
 - L1 Chinese, L2 English, L3 Spanish.
 - They report similar perceptual boundaries in the L2 and L3 of the participants. 
]

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> See final slides

.large[
Issues:

Low sample size may cause underpowered studies. 

No model of L3 phonology. 

Most studies are in L3 production.

Tie back in with L3 models - will the perceive the L3 as the same as their L2, or will the more typologically similar language influence it?

# Literature Review

.large[
**Bilingual Phonology and the double phonemic boundary effect**

- Bilinguals often have to encounter situations in which the use of more than one language is plausible. 
]

--

.large[
- Bilinguals' categorization of sounds seems to be modulated by the language that they believe they are hearing. <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

- English and Spanish both contrast bilabial stops based on voicing, /b/-/p/, 
though the phonetic realizations differ in each language. 

- English distinguishes between lag stops, whereas Spanish distinguishes 
between pre-voiced and short-lag stops. 

- Bilingual speakers regulate fine-phonetic detail such as this by seamlessly 
adjusting to the ambient languages.

# Research questions

.big[
- Building on previous DPBE studies, I added a third continuum in a "third language", which I told participants was either French or Hungarian. 
]

--

.large[
- As in previous studies, the acoustic continua are identical in each session. 
]

--

.large[
- The only difference is that the participants are informed that they are hearing sounds 
from a particular language
]
---

# Research questions

.large[.pull-left[
**RQ1:** Will the double phonemic boundary effect found in previous studies be replicated and extended to vowels?

**RQ2:** Will the participants' categorizations of what they believe are the L3 continua resemble their categorizations of either their L1 or their L2? 

**RQ3:** Will categorizations of what participants believe to be Hungarian or French result in different “language specific” categorization between L3 groups?
]]

--

.large[.pull-right[
**H1:** Yes.

**H2:** Yes. The L3 French groups will categorize the L3 as Spanish-like, the L3 Hungarian groups will categorize the L3 as their L2. 

**H3:** Yes for the Spanish L1 group, but not for the English L1 group
]]

---

# Methods

.large[
**Participants**

- Mirror Image groups of Spanish-English bilinguals.
 - English L1 (n = 36) and Spanish L1 groups (n = 55).
]

--

.large[
- These groups were further randomly subdivided into L3 groups: either the French or Hungarian.
 - Spanish L1 Hungarian (n = 31)
 - Spanish L1 French (n = 18)
 - English L1 Hungarian (n = 17)
 - English L1 French (n = 17)
]

--

.large[
- Prediction: French will bias the use of Spanish, Hungarian will bias the use of the L2.

# Methods

.large[
**Materials**

- The participants completed three 2afc tasks 
 - Programmed in Psychopy (Pierce et al., 2019)

- Language History Questionnaire (LHQ 3.0, Li et al., 2020) 
 - Gathered language L1 group and language background

- lexTALE proficiency test in their L2 (Izur et al., 2016; Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2016)
 - Lexical desicion task that measure L2 vocabulary 
 - Provided a continuous measure of proficiency 
]
 
---

# Materials 

.large[
- A voicing and vowel continuum were used in the 2afc tasks
]

--

.large[
- A step of a respective continuum was added to the beginning of the second syllable of a pseudoword and two words were presented on screen. 
 - *pafri* and *bafri* were the given choices in the stops contimuum 
 - *ifri* and *ufri* were the given choices in the vowel continuum <sup>1</sup>
]
.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Distinct language specific spelling was used in the pseudowords of the vowel continuum. 
]

--

.large[
 - the stop continuum used in previous studies was used here: it contained 17 steps and ranged in VOT from -35 to 50ms 
]

.large[
 - A vowel continuum was also created and used in order to evaluate the predictions of full transfer models
  - It contained 11 steps, ranged from /i/ to /u/, and varied only in F2
]

# Results 

.large[
**Analysis**

- The responses of each continuum were then analyzed by fitting logistic regression models to each participant in each continuum.
 - DV: choice /p/ or /u/
 - IVs: continuum step
]

--

.large[
- A crossover (co) boundary was then calculated per participant, per language, per continuum for a total of 6 co boundaries per participant. 
 - `co = intercept / slope * -1`
 - `co` is the continuum step at which the probability of either choice is 50%
]

--

.large[
- The `co` dataframe was then used for a series of paired t-tests and post-hoc tests of equivalence. 
]

**L3 categorizations**

- T-tests of the crossovers suggested that L3 groups did not categorize the continua differently whether they were assigned to the Hungarian group or the French group, and regardless of their first language. 
]

.large[

Hungarian vs French groups
- English L1: vowels (t(31.25)=0.10, p=.924) or stops (t(37.81)=0.55, p=.585).  

- Spanish L1: vowels (t(29.90)=0.57, p=.573) and stops (t(10.89)=0.28, p=.788).

# Results

.large[
**L3 categorizations**

- Since the L3 groups may not have categorized the L3 differently, their results were pooled in order to carry out a post-hoc analysis.
]

--

.large[
- The purpose of this analysis was to provide more robust evidence of the categorizations of the continua in both L1 groups. 
]

---

# Post-hoc analysis 

.large[
- Tests of equivalence were carried out using the `toster` function in R.

- Cohen's D was set to .5, a medium effect size <sup>1</sup>, for the upper and lower equivalence bounds.

# Extended Results

**Spanish-English categorizations paired t-test**

- Spanish and English were categorized differently in 3 out of 4 possible combinations:

 - The English L1 group showed a double phonemic boundary effect in stops (t(24)=2.24, p=.035), but not in vowels (t(35)=-0.72, p=.477). 

 - The Spanish L1 group showed evidence of the double phonemic boundary in both stops (t(51)=3.13, p=.003) and vowels (t(49)=3.77, p<.001)
 
---

# Extended Results

**Spanish L1 pooled stops TOST** 

L1 and L3 categorizations were found to be equivalent.

On the other hand, English and the L3 were not found to be equivalent and nor were Spanish and English. 

L1 - L2 (t(45) = -0.770, p = 0.223).

L1 - L3 (t(45) = -3.094, **p = 0.00169**)

L2 - L3 (t(45) = -1.103, p = 0.138)

**Spanish L1 pooled vowels TOST**  

L1 and L3 categorizations were equivalent, other combinations were not:

L1 - L2 (t(45) = 0.536, p = 0.703)

L1 - L3 (t(45) = -2.949, **p = 0.00252**)

L2 - L3 (t(45) = 0.198, p = 0.578)

---

# Extended Results

**English L1 pooled stops TOST**

L2 and L3 categorizations could be equivalent, but there is not enough data to make this determination. 

L1 - L2 (t(22) = 0.427, p = 0.663)

L1 - L3 (t(22) = -0.527, p = 0.302)

L2 - L3 (t(22) = 1.441, p = 0.0818)

This finding suggests that the English L1 group might show L2 status effects and would trend oppositely of the Spanish L1 group.
