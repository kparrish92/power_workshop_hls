**Typology predicts L2 learning difficulty**

When languages are typologically similar, they will likely be easier to learn (e.g. a Spanish speaker learning Brazilian Portuguese)

**Typology might also predict phonological learning**

This is also likely true for phonological learning: closely related languages are likely more easily acquired than those that are not.

**Perception drives L2 learning**

New category formation is one part of phonological learning and is argued to be driven by perception (van Luessen & Escudero, 2015; Best & Tyler, 2007).

L2 models suggest that this formation occurs based on **sound contrasts** present in both languages. 
]]]

# Background 

.pull-left[
.large[
**What do we want to know?** 

Are more categories/contrasts ultimately better? 

Overall, it's not well known whether speakers who have acquired a second language remain influenced by their L1 categories when they learn an additional (third) language.

.pull-right[
.large[
**How will it be investigated?** 

The present work examines whether bilinguals make use of both their L1 and L2 categories when they are asked to categorize new language sounds.

# Complication: L3 learners might only be influenced by a single source language

.footnote[
Rothman (2015); Bardel & Falk (2007)
]

---

# Background 

.pull-left[
.large[
**Access to both the L1 and L2 is debated** 

Some models predict that L3 learners only have **access to one source language.** (The L2 Status Factor; the Typological Primacy Model) 

Others predict **access to both languages.** (The Linguistic Proximity Model; the Scalpel Model)
]]

--

.pull-right[
.large[
**There is not much data in perception** 

Wrembel et al. (2019) found that L3 vowels were assimilated to both L1 and L2 categories, with a preference for the L2 sounds in young learners of L3 Polish. 
]]

# The Present Study 

The present study adds to the debate by:

.pull-left[
.content-box-grey[
**Novelty 1**
Using Naïve L3 learners to aim to establish how L3 perception looks at the very beginning.

This helps rule out that potential observations of L3 learners are due to exposure and not influence etc. 
]]

.pull-right[
.content-box-grey[
**Novelty 2**
Including a new language triad in perception (English, Spanish, French)

Crosslinguistic support for model predictions increases their robustness.

# The Present Study 

.big[
.pull-left[
**Spanish-English bilinguals** in both orders of acquisition who did not speak a third language participated in the experiments.  
]]

--

.big[
.pull-right[
A **Vowel categorization task** was done, where they heard an L3 French vowel and categorized it given vowel categories in both English and Spanish.

# Research Questions

.pull-left[
.full-width[
.content-box-grey[
.large[
.blue[RQ1]: Are L3 sounds at first exposure categorized using both L1 and L2 categories? 

.blue[RQ2]: Does language status or global typological similarity impact categorization?  
]]]]


--

.pull-right[
.full-width[
.content-box-grey[
.large[
.blue[H1]: L3 sounds will assimilate to both L1 and L2 categories. 

.blue[H2a]: If order of acquisition does not matter, difference in the **most probable selection** given a particular phoneme should be minimal between groups. 

.blue[H2b]: If global typology does not matter, when both Spanish and English are equally good choices, they should be equally as probable.

# Participants

**Bilingual groups:**

American English L1 - Spanish L2 group (n = `r nrow(eng_blp)`)

Mexican Spanish L1 - English L2 group (n = `r nrow(span_blp)`)

.content-box-blue[
**Profiles:**

Completed the **Bilingual Language Profile** (Birdsong et al., 2012) and a **vowel categorization task**.

Answered "no" to the questions "Do you speak any languages in addition to English and Spanish?"

Participants' data was removed who reported that they "do not feel comfortable speaking" their L2 (English L1, n = 5; Spanish L1, n = 5)

**Specifically**:  

/i/ - both English and Spanish were probable.

# Discussion

.pull-left[
**Neither language status nor global language similarity impact categorizations**

Segment by segment acoustic differences are the most likely guiding factor of novel language categorization. 
]

--

.pull-right[
**Findings**

It is unclear whether L3 learning and L2 learning should be considered distinct in perception. 

Categorizations seem to be guided by acoustics.

L3 prediction of might follow L2 models, differing only in that L3 learners likely have more categories to assimilate L3 sounds to.
