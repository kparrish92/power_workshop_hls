### PhD Candidate

#### Rutgers University

<p align="justify">
I am a PhD Candidate in the Second Language Acquisition and Bilingualism program working with [Professor Joseph V. Casillas](https://www.jvcasillas.com/about.html). in the Spanish and Portuguese Department at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. 
I am also a current member of the [Rutgers Applied Phonetics](https://www.rap-group.jvcasillas.com) group working with Professor Casillas and other colleagues at Rutgers.
My main interests are in third language acquisition, phonetics and phonology, and language pedagogy. 
My primary aim/interest is how bilinguals acquire the phonetics and phonology of a third language.
In particular, my research involves Spanish-English bilinguals and their learning of a new language with a focus on near first exposure.
My recent projects have involved novel-language production by bilinguals, perception in the same population, and exploratory analysis related to which factors might be associated with the variation observed in cross-linguistic influence from either a first or second language in third language learning.
Outside of work and school, I love dogs (I have three), American football (go Panthers!) and language learning.
