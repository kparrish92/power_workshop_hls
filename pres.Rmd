If you are using R for the first time, you might need to install the tidyverse package.

To do so, click "*packages*" in the lower right quadrant of your screen, then "*install*"

Now, type "tidyverse" in the search box and click install. 

Installation should take less than a minute, and you're good to go!

Power is important for the rate of false negative findings in research

A **false negative finding** is one in which we conclude that there is not an effect when one actually exists.

False negative rate = 1 - power
 - If power = .8, then .2 is the false negative rate.

# Effect sizes 

Cohen's D is a measure of effect size and measures differences between groups.

Cohen (1988) suggested as a guideline that a small effect size is d = .2, a medium effect size is d = .5, and a large effect is d = .8.

Plonsky & Oswald (2015) determined that effect sizes are generally higher in language research; (Small = .4, Medium = .7, Large = .8)

# How is a power analysis done? 

---

# Simulate the sampling distribution 

In research, we often assume we are taking a sample from a greater distribution. 

Here, we simulate two underlying distributions, one with a mean of 38 (sd = 20) and the other with a mean of 30 (sd = 20).

The actual effect size of these distributions is d = .4 - a small effect.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)

# Assign the intended mean and sd of each group to an object
mean1 = 38
mean2 = 30
sd1 = 20
sd2 = 20

#### Use Rnorm to simulate a distribution of 10,000 points, using our previously 
#### specified mean and sd.

s1 = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = mean1, sd = sd1)
s2 = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = mean2, sd = sd2)
```

---

# Calculate effect size 

- We can also calculate the effect size in R, given two means and standard deviations.

```{r}
# Create a function to calculate Cohen's D 
effect_size = function(mean1, mean2, sd1, sd2)
{
  mean_diff = mean1 - mean2
  pooled_sd = sqrt(((sd1^2 + sd2^2)/2))
  
  es = mean_diff/pooled_sd  
  return(es)
}

# Use the function - also using our values specified earlier.
effect_size(mean1, mean2, sd1, sd2)
```

---

# Running a power analysis

.pull-left[
- Here we create a function to run a power analysis, which randomly samples from our previously simulated dataset. 

- The code uses a `for` loop to randomly choose a random quantity of samples (rows) from each of the two dataframes of 10,000 and runs a t.test on the two random samples.

- From there, it calculates the **power** by summing the quantity of the t.tests that were significant and dividing them by the total number of iterations.

**Activity 1 - Calculating Effect Sizes**
]

Let's fill out this table, starting with the **effect size** column.


|   | Mean group 1 (sd) | Mean group 2 (sd) | Effect Size | Needed number of participants |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | 46 (20)           | 30 (20)           |             |                               |
| 2 | 40 (20)           | 30 (20)           |             |                               |
| 3 | 33 (20)           | 30 (20)           |             |                               |

**Activity 1 - Calculating Effect Sizes (Solution)**
]

We can use our `effect_size` function from earlier to calculate each effect size. 

```{r, fig.retina = 4}
effect_size(mean1 = 46, mean2 = 30, sd1 = 20, sd2 = 20) # comparison 1

effect_size(mean1 = 40, mean2 = 30, sd1 = 20, sd2 = 20) # comparison 2

effect_size(mean1 = 34, mean2 = 30, sd1 = 20, sd2 = 20) # comparison 3
```

**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed?**
]

Now that we have some information about the size of each effect, let's figure out how many participants we need to detect each of these effects at a power level of .8. 
Choose **one** of these three and create a power curve.

|   | Mean group 1 (sd) | Mean group 2 (sd) | Effect Size | Needed number of participants |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | 46 (20)           | 30 (20)           |   .8        |                               |
| 2 | 40 (20)           | 30 (20)           |   .5        |                               |
| 3 | 34 (20)           | 30 (20)           |   .2        |                               |

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Large, d = .8)**
]

First, we simulate our sampling distribution. 

```{r, fig.retina = 3}
set.seed(1)

s1_l = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 46, sd = 20)
s2_l = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 30, sd = 20)
```

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Large, d = .8)**
]
.pull-left[
Next, we decide our samples to try, and re-use the `plot_power_curve_ul` function to create a power curve plot. 

Let's go with multiples of 10 up to 120.

The plot shows we need around **30** participants per group to achieve a power level of .80.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.retina = 4}
# Trying larger sample sizes
sample_sizes = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120)
plot_power_curve_ul(s1 = s1_l, s2 = s2_l, i = 1000, sample_sizes)
```
]

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Medium, d = .5)**
]

Let's repeat the process for the medium effect.

Again, we simulate our sampling distribution. 

```{r, fig.retina = 3}
set.seed(1)

s1_m = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 40, sd = 20)
s2_m = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 30, sd = 20)
```

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Medium, d = .5)**
]

.pull-left[
Again, we decide our samples to try, and re-use the `plot_power_curve_ul` function to create a power curve plot. 

Given that we needed 30 for the large effect (d = .8), we will keep our sample sizes the same.

The plot shows we need around **70** participants per group to achieve a power level of .80.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.retina = 3}
sample_sizes = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120)

plot_power_curve_ul(s1 = s1_m, s2 = s2_m, i = 1000, sample_sizes)
```
]

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Small, d = .2)**
]

Finally, let's see how many we need for a small effect (d = .2).

Again, we simulate our sampling distribution. 

```{r, fig.retina = 3}
set.seed(1)

s1_s = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 34, sd = 20)
s2_s = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 30, sd = 20)
```

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Small, d = .2)**
]

.pull-left[
We will again re-use the `plot_power_curve_ul` function to create a power curve plot. 

This is a pretty small effect, so it's likely we will need more than 100 participants per group. Let's try 10-200 in multiples of 10.

The plot shows we need more than **200** participants per group to achieve a power level of .80.


```{r, fig.retina = 3}
set.seed(1)
sample_sizes = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 
                 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r, fig.retina = 3}
plot_power_curve_ul(s1 = s1_s, s2 = s2_s, i = 1000, sample_sizes)
```
]

---

.large[
**Activity 2 - How many participants are needed? (Small, d = .2)**
]

.pull-left[
Let's increase the samples further, this time in multiples of 25 from 25-400.

This plot suggests we need a hefty **400 participants per group** to reliably detect an effect size of .2.

```{r, fig.retina = 3}
set.seed(1)
sample_sizes = c(50, 100, 150, 200,
                 250, 300, 350, 400,
                 450, 500)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.retina = 3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_power_curve_ul(s1 = s1_s, s2 = s2_s, i = 1000, sample_sizes) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, by = 50))
```
]

Power analysis is a crucial part of a research design.

Ensuring higher powered studies helps reduce false negatives and promotes replicability.

This workshop uses the t-test to run a power analysis, but other statistical tests may also be used.
