########## Author: Kyle Parrish, 11/4/22 ######### 


## 1. What is the effect size and power of this difference:
## Group 1 mean = 25 (15)
## Group 2 mean = 20 (15)
## Group 1 n = 15
## Group 2 n = 15


## 2. What is the effect size power of this difference:
## Group 1 mean = 25 (15)
## Group 2 mean = 20 (15)
## Group 1 n = 15
## Group 2 n = 15


## 3. How many participants do you need for for 1 and 2?

## Group 1 mean = 25 (5)
## Group 2 mean = 20 (5)

## Group 1 mean = 30 (5)
## Group 2 mean = 20 (5)

## Bonus:
## Think of any study that you have recently read that reported 
## a mean and standard deviation of two groups. Calculate the 
## power of the reported effect using the functions above.
